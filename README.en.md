## Installation

This package requires an OXID eShop installed with Composer in a version defined in the [composer.json](composer.json).

Please enter the following section in the `composer.json` of your project:

```
  "extra": {
    "ajgl-symlinks": {
      "maximebf/debugbar": {
        "src/DebugBar/Resources": "source/out/debugbar"
      }
    },
    "enable-patching": "true",

      }
    }
  }
```

Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of the shop (parent directory of source and vendor). Execute the following command. Adapt the path details to your installation environment.


```bash
php composer require d3/modulename:^2.0
``` 

If necessary, please confirm that you allow `composer-symlinker` to execute code.

Activate the module in Shopadmin under "Extensions -> Modules".
